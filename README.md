# Milestones

Milestones and the goal is to have an easy to use front end where a user can: create a secure account, login to their home page, add family photos to a general feed, create a family tree with bios and images for each family member (relationship to user so that same person can be user A's mom and user B's aunt), have seperate profiles for their young children with their bios and images, and the most important feature: add their child's developmental milestones (this is where an API will come in to play) to showcase each child's growth.This data will be based on early childhood developmental milestones. The app will have a check list containing the milestones, a place for a description, the date, and some photos. I was not able to find an API that I could access so in the upcoming weeks I hope to create my own database to populate the Milestones section of this app. Click the image on the left to see the Github Repo.
